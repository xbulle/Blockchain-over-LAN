## Running instructions

Running main.py in /src will start the code.
The code is developed in PyCharm, and therefore the __init__.py are not initialized, and may not work in default python3 cli


Use the `--enable-debug` option to run on localhost and pass no argument to run on LAN.
Example:

For example, `python3 /src/main.py --enable-debug`

Or add a Run Configuration with --enable-debug as parameter in PyCharm.
